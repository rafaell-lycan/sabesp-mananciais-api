#Sabesp API

##About
This project is a very simple API to crawl Sabesp API website, parse relative data to JSON object and save data about past days in our database.

##Why?
Because when I start this project, we doesn't have another resource like this to retrive data about water in São Paulo, and at that time I want to create a simple mobile App to visualize that information, so, I start to develop this project.
